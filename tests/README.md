# Tests

The retained tests protect current `.ninfer`, numerical operator, model, runtime-transaction,
benchmark-report, and external protocol behavior. Repository verification principles are defined in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md); Op contract and CUDA implementation guidance is in
[`../docs/maintainer/op-development.md`](../docs/maintainer/op-development.md).

## Organization

The Linux CPU-only `ninfer_video_source_service_test` generates CFR/VFR, audio,
interlaced and nonzero-start fixtures with FFmpeg, then checks frame mappings
against ffprobe presentation timestamps, cache reuse, file invalidation and retry.
Run it together with `ninfer_qwen3_5_local_video_payload_test` after changing the
shared video service. Neither test loads a model or uses CUDA execution.

- `artifact/` — v3 framing, directory/binding records, codecs, sharding, selected-object
  materialization and Python-writer/C++-reader interoperability;
- `convert/` — source interpretation, Qwen logical mapping, recipe overrides/sharing, optional
  components, resources, proposals and numerical conversion methods;
- `models/qwen3_5/` — config/binding, frontend, state/context stores, workspace, MTP alignment and
  opt-in real Engine integration;
- `ops/` — semantic Op qualification with independent mathematical or state-transition oracles;
  Linear and fused Linear suites are separated by their supported weight/activation paths;
- root C++ tests — core storage, runtime admission/resource policy, public API, serving protocols,
  logging, benchmark reports and causal-scoring evaluation;
- `test_serve_corpus.py` — agreement between the serving request-log schema and its measurement
  consumer.

Tests are grouped by observable risk, not by mirroring every source file or class.
`ninfer_vmm_suspend_test` is the GPU suspend prerequisite PoC: it releases and creates
physical backing at the same three reserved addresses 1000 times, replays one captured
GraphExec, checks the complete persistent snapshot and its internal pointers, and poisons
fresh workspace before each replay. It returns CTest skip code 77 without usable CUDA/VMM.
`ninfer_suspend_backing_test` qualifies the opt-in arena and both overlay pools across
detach/new-backing attach, arena moves and detached destruction, create/map/access fault
cleanup, busy rejection, and subsequent overlay loans using the new handles.
On Linux, standalone `ninfer_suspend_pool_failure_test` injects create/map/access failures at
the second piece of both pools. Its 18 cases also cover rollback unmap/release failures,
immediate release of successful pieces and destructor retry of only the retained resources.
`ninfer_evictable_kv_pool_test` qualifies the tuned physical lending pieces independently of
logical KV pages: partial payload boundaries, rounded windows, discontiguous leases, live-page
isolation, lease-failure rollback, fragmented/promised-page refusal, and payload lending beyond
256 pages per piece. It also refuses a full-pool early loan that would consume pending activation
demand. Its fixtures follow the compiled piece size without a full model.
`ninfer_model_suspend_test` runs a generated two-layer attention/GDN artifact with
supported dense geometry and BF16/row-scaled FP8 weights through the public Engine:
opt-in/disabled handling, active and queued request rejection, repeated fresh-backing generation,
concurrent management/status calls, zero-output submission rejection while suspended and
1000 zero-output submissions racing ten suspend/resume cycles,
immutable-source failure with retained diagnostics/snapshot, and suspended/error destruction.
An additional 32768-slot KV fixture checks three restores of a persistent snapshot larger than
64 MiB in both pinned and pageable modes, including token equality, device backing release,
startup pinned capacity/reuse and pageable RAM release after resume. Disabled suspend allocates no buffer.
Hybrid Host-cache persistence is checked across both Ready and Suspended shutdown, followed by
startup restoration of saved blocks/snapshots and generation comparison. Failed-resume ERROR
shutdown must not save the cache.
On Linux, test-only link wrapping pauses a zero-output submission after its initial availability
check. Suspend completes before that submission continues, so final admission must reject it.
This deterministically covers the race; removing final admission makes the test fail.
It is standalone for targeted GPU acceptance without rebuilding the complete test bundle.
Linux standalone `ninfer_suspend_restore_completion_test` stages the persistent H2D into pinned
memory and holds its default-stream DMA behind a callback gate. It requires RESUMING and retained
snapshot until completion, then checks successful generation or an injected synchronization
failure with ERROR, rejected admission and retained diagnostics/snapshot, in both memory modes.
It also injects a startup pin allocation failure, verifies actual pinned storage, one allocation
across repeated cycles, and buffer release on Suspended shutdown using test-only CUDA link wrapping.
`ninfer_suspend_upload_timing_test` covers ordinary, transcode-only and mixed weight restores.
A bounded delay inside transcode upload must appear in the reported duration; restored bytes and
transfer counts are also checked. Both use test-only linker wrapping and skip without CUDA/VMM.
`ninfer_model_residency_http_test` uses the same generated artifact with a real HTTP listener
to check authentication, public aliases, management body validation, service response reservations,
suspended inference rejection, explicit/idempotent resume and ERROR diagnostics. The CLI and
serve option tests are standalone too, so these checks can build independently of the full bundle.
The HTTP cases run with suspend enabled and disabled for ordinary slash aliases and aliases ending
in one or two `/residency` segments; model detail, status, model list and generation must retain the
exact public alias without route collisions.
The HTTP suite also covers default automatic resume and explicit manual suspension, strict boolean
body validation, policy changes while suspended, all three generation protocols, SSE, rejected
authentication/input/model IDs without restoration, token-count exclusion and failed automatic resume.
Linux standalone `ninfer_auto_resume_test` holds restore at a test-only CUDA synchronization gate:
concurrent requests must share one restore, count against ingress capacity and respect cancellation
and pending deadlines. A cancelled leader must leave other requests usable; an injected restore
failure must reach all waiters and prevent subsequent automatic retry.
`ninfer_qwen3_5_suspend_real_test` is a standalone opt-in real-artifact acceptance executable:
pass an explicit artifact, PNG and KV capacity. It checks exact text and Vision token vectors
over three fresh-backing resumes, forces actual overlay execution, and reports KV versus weight
loan use. The `cache` mode compares an already reused image frontier before and after suspend.
Failure modes and an optional separate 20 GiB borrower are acceptance-only controls; build and
run instructions are in [`../tools/suspend-dev/README.md`](../tools/suspend-dev/README.md).
Without explicit arguments it skips with code 77. Its single-GPU configuration uses rk8v4,
FP16 GDN state and MTP3; HTTP/Graph endurance is tested separately by `acceptance.py`.
`CMakeLists.txt` includes explicit registrations from `cmake/`, `artifact/`, `models/qwen3_5/`
and `ops/`. Registration helpers live in `cmake/NinferTests.cmake`; included manifests keep
executables and CTest working directories under `build/tests/`.

Tests link into one executable, `ninfer_tests`, rather than one each: every test that links the
Op library would otherwise carry its own copy of the whole kernel image (~450 MB on sm_86), which
added up to tens of GB. Each test keeps its name as a program in the bundle and still runs in its
own process under CTest. Run one by hand with `build/tests/ninfer_tests <name> [args...]`;
`ninfer_tests --list` prints the names. `ninfer_jinja_test` and
`ninfer_artifact_materialization_test` stay standalone because Python tests invoke them by path.
The materialization test checks patterned continuation payloads larger than the four-slot staging
ring through startup and three same-address restores, with an unchanged 256 MiB staging bound.
A truncated continuation also exercises parallel read failure while uploads are in flight.
A test's helpers and entry function must be internal (anonymous namespace) so that programs do not
collide at link time. The mechanism is `cmake/NinferBundles.cmake`.
`ops/op_tester.h` and `ops/op_check.h` own only reusable device/guard and comparison mechanics.
Concrete numerical criteria remain named by the semantic Op suite; there are no cross-Op tolerance
presets.

`ops/quantized_weight.h` is the common packed-weight fixture for Q4/Q5/Q6/Q8, FP8 and NVFP4 Op tests. It
owns deterministic payload generation, device `Weight` views, row views, and independent logical
weight decoding.

## Build and run

Select a Python environment with the dependencies for the tests first. The maintained environment
uses Python 3.11; CMake finds Python 3 without restricting its minor version.
`Python3_EXECUTABLE` selects the interpreter used by interop and frontend tests explicitly.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$(command -v python3)"
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Alternatively, `cmake --preset dev` enables products, tests and benchmarks together.
After building, `ctest --preset dev` runs the same CTest suite. See
[Build system](../docs/maintainer/build-system.md) for local interpreter presets.

The chat-template reference test uses Python Jinja2.

Run a focused target for a localized change:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_tests
ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_sampling_test --output-on-failure
```

Enable uniform floating-point error records when establishing or reviewing an Op criterion:

```bash
NINFER_OP_REPORT_STATS=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build -V -R '^ninfer_(rmsnorm|softmax_attention)_test$'
```

Every participating comparison emits one `OP_ERROR_STATS` record containing the stable case label,
actual error, active limit, and error-to-limit ratio. The switch changes reporting only; the same
statistics still drive the normal verdict. Passing tests remain quiet without it.

## Running a test under compute-sanitizer

`memcheck` and `initcheck` both work on these binaries, including the large statically linked ones.
Invoke it unqualified so `PATH` resolves it:

```bash
compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --error-exitcode 9 \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_softmax_attention_test
```

**Do not call the copy under `CUDA/v12.4/compute-sanitizer/` by absolute path.** Two copies are
installed on a typical toolkit layout, and the 2024.1.0 one in v12.4 prints its banner and
`ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors`, exits 0, and **never executes the binary** — a clean report having
checked nothing. `PATH` resolves `compute-sanitizer` to the v12.8 launcher, which is the working
one, so the unqualified form above is safe.

Two messages that look like failures and are not:

- *"Target application terminated before first instrumented API call"* — the test made no CUDA
  calls, usually because it skipped for a missing `NINFER_*_WEIGHTS` environment variable. Set the
  variable, or pick a test that does not need one.
- A single `-k 'regex:a|b'`-style argument disappearing in PowerShell: `|` is parsed as a pipeline
  before the tool sees it. One pattern per invocation.

`ncu` needs one thing more: GPU performance counters are administrator-only by default on Windows
and it fails with `ERR_NVGPUCTRPERM` otherwise. Run it from an elevated shell — that satisfies the
permission per-run, with nothing persistent and no reboot.
`scripts/sweeps/admin-profile.ps1` does this for the profiles the maintainer notes reference.

The variable-width DFlash2 target-attention subset can be run with
`./build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_softmax_attention_test --dflash2-only`. It covers D256/Q24/KV4 across all five
cache codecs, W=2..16, B=1..8, request-local prefixes, cache effects, and Graph metadata/input
updates. The default executable also runs the existing attention geometries and prefill tests.

Linear tests are independently runnable by weight and activation-compute profile:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_tests
ctest --test-dir build -R '^ninfer_linear_(q4|q5|q6|q8)_a16_test$' --output-on-failure
```

All Linear files use `ops/linear/linear_test_common.{h,cpp}` and the same
`ops/quantized_weight.h` fixture as the fused projection tests. The fixture produces the complete
packed GPU payload and exact-decodes the logical float rows used by the one
`cpu_linear_gemm_fp64()` reference. The reference performs naive double accumulation and never
reproduces a production route's activation quantization, staging, reduction tree, or BF16 output
rounding. Each activation compute path selects one centrally defined comparison tolerance for its
whole suite; private kernel, schedule, launcher, and T selection do not change it. Individual test
files call public `linear()` and contain no private selector, launcher, schedule, or kernel
assertions.

The Linear, LinearAdd and LinearSwiGLU common `.cpp` implementations each compile once into a
test support library. Both those libraries and the Op test executables receive the oracle's
`-fno-fast-math` and `-ffp-contract=off` options on GNU/Clang C++ compilers.

Run the native Python suites with the project Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  tests/artifact tests/convert \
  tests/test_serve_corpus.py tests/test_speed_of_light.py
```

The Python suites exercise conversion and encoded output, without running model inference.
The maintained environment uses Python 3.11 with the dependencies for those suites. C++ binding and Engine tests
cover consumption of their resulting representation.

The real loading test accepts an explicit artifact path and optional component selection:

```bash
./build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_loading_real_test \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer --vision --speculative mtp --proposal optimized
```

Add `--host-only` to check semantic binding without uploading weights. This does not construct a
Program or establish native Op support.

The C++ prefix/MTP integration test is separately opt-in because it loads the full artifact and
runs the real engine. It accepts Qwen3.6 and Qwen3.8 artifacts; its prompt-token goldens are kept
per model generation because each registers its own chat template:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_prefix_real_test --output-on-failure
```

The causal-scoring integration test uses the same artifact variable and checks a full 1,024-column
score tile, overlapping target suffixes, and repeated-window State/KV isolation:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_score_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Run the 35B-A3B MoE route independently:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_moe_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Without `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT`, CTest marks these real Engine tests as skipped. Run GPU integration
tests serially. `NINFER_PREFIX_REAL_SCENARIO` selects a focused prefix scenario such as `vision`,
`pressure-resume` or `concurrent`; the default is `all`. These integration checks
use behavior and state accounting rather than another numerical path's generated tokens as a golden.

The capability-evaluation coordinator has its own environment and unittest entry point:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover \
  -s eval/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Run the serving contract manually after starting a resident server in another terminal:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

```bash
python3 -m tools.smoke.serve_contract \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 --model qwen3.6-27b
```

This smoke check is intentionally not a CTest: it needs the real artifact, a supported GPU, and a
server process that remains alive while the client exercises OpenAI Responses/Chat, Anthropic,
state, streaming, and multimodal requests.

The thinking-preservation fixture starts and stops its own server, submits a fixed two-step tool
history, compares stripped and preserved closed-turn prompt lengths, and verifies compatible
prefix reuse, speculative execution, frontier bounds and Responses inheritance:

```bash
python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer --backend mtp

python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer --backend dflash
```

The shared messages are in
[`fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json`](fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json).

## What belongs here

A permanent test should protect one current risk, such as:

- exact artifact bytes, geometry, object binding, or conversion transform;
- a numerical operator contract with an independent oracle;
- model Frontend or Program frontier, prefix, MTP, or multimodal behavior;
- generated-token commit/stop/cancel consistency;
- public benchmark or OpenAI/Anthropic observable behavior;
- a reproduced supported bug.

Performance-only assertions belong in benchmarks and profiler review. Source scans,
implementation-shape assertions, trivial getters/configuration, retired command surfaces, and
broad additions without a concrete regression risk do not belong in the permanent suite.

## DFlash2 Engine integration

The real test uses an artifact containing DFlash2 and checks output budgets, speculative activity,
penalty-enabled sampling, compact batches with unequal budgets, same-route same-seed replay,
retained/fresh prefix behavior and absence of a full backend KV pool. A shared DFlash/DFlash2 fixture starts decode at token 63, verifies across the page
boundary, stops after one target column at token 64, and checks the exact retained frontier and
subsequent generation with and without reuse.
The KV Store test checks exact mapping and reservation accounting for the same transition.
K>=7 also exercises a stop inside a licensed block; K=15 additionally checks oversized prefill,
local ring wrap, and the logical context-capacity tail. Optional Vision runs image/video capture
and prefix restore. Zero extra Device StateImage slots exercise Host snapshot/restore.

```bash
cmake --build build -j --target ninfer_tests
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash2_real_test 15 1 1 8
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash2_real_test 7 1 0 2 bf16 1 0
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash2_real_test 2 0 0 2 int8
```

Arguments are K, Graph enabled, optimized head enabled, maximum B, target KV (`bf16` or `int8`),
Vision enabled, and extra Device StateImage slots. Defaults are `15 1 1 8 bf16 0 3`. Run GPU
integration tests serially. The individual Op suites remain the numerical/state-transition oracle;
the fixed Engine fixture does not define bit parity across arbitrary floating-point routes.

## Structured output

The CPU grammar and protocol tests and the GPU sampling/speculative tests qualify this path:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R 'ninfer_(structured_output|sampling|speculative_round|openai_schema|openai_responses|anthropic_schema|cli_options|prompt_input|tool_call_parser|qwen3_5_frontend|qwen3_5_structured_round)_test$'
```

`tests/test_structured_output_live.py` runs a temporary loopback server and validates completed
outputs with the independent Python `jsonschema` validator. Use Python 3.11 with `requests` and
`jsonschema` installed in a test environment. Supply an explicit v3 artifact containing the
selected speculative backends; the test never downloads or converts weights.

```bash
python tests/test_structured_output_live.py \
  --server build/apps/ninfer-serve --artifact /absolute/path/model.ninfer \
  --output-dir work/structured-live --modes none mtp dflash2 dflash2-eager
```

It checks conflicting prompts, greedy and stochastic generation, schema versus JSON object mode,
concurrent and mixed traffic, prefix reuse, SSE, token limits, disconnect cleanup, compile errors,
Responses, and Anthropic Messages. It also runs a tool-result-to-bounded-JSON exchange while
reasoning and multiple tools remain enabled, including a Markdown-formatted example in the prompt.
CPU tests cover numeric endpoints, schema enforcement with tool alternatives, split and mixed-token
reasoning transitions, speculative mask previews, injected thinking-budget closure, and prompt cache
boundary preservation. `--concurrency 8 --draft-tokens 15 --modes dflash2` exercises
the largest draft and batch dimensions. A separate DFlash-capable artifact can use `--modes dflash`.
The server is terminated on success or failure. An occupied test port causes the test to stop.

The old/new Qwen3.8 binding matrix uses `out/qwen3_8_27b_old.ninfer` and
`out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4_old.ninfer` for the legacy inventories, and the canonical filenames above
for the companion artifacts. The legacy paths may be overridden with
`NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_OLD_WEIGHTS` and `NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_NVFP4_OLD_WEIGHTS`.

## Container build cache

Check the Dockerfile's incremental-build and configuration-invalidation behavior without compiling
or running NInfer:

```bash
bash tests/test_docker_build_cache.sh docker
```

This uses the real build stage with a tiny CMake fixture and isolated cache mounts. It checks added
and removed compiler flags, changed and restored cached defaults, environment flags, old header
timestamps, non-code edits, and one-file incremental compilation. Docker BuildKit is required;
`podman` can be passed instead to check that builder. Logs and the fixture remain in an ignored
`build-cache-test.*` directory; the test image and its small build caches remain in the builder.
The check needs the Dockerfile's build dependencies but no GPU or model weights.

`ninfer_video_mcp_http_test` is CPU-only on Linux. It generates a small FFmpeg
fixture and verifies the production MCP transport/tools over a real HTTP socket,
including embedded schema equality, metadata/resolve/inspect, malformed requests,
Host/Origin validation and session termination. Run with the video source and
local-video payload regressions: `ctest -R 'video_mcp_http|video_source_service|local_video_payload'`.
